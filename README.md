# Cypress IO Example Project
The goal of this repo is to build a project using Cypress IO as the test automation framework to showcase proficiency with the tool.

## Current Status
Currently there is one test and one page object file. The test navigates to [NIKE](https://wwww.nike.com), validates that the URL contains the correct word (nike), and that the NIKE home page icon (a swoosh) is visible.

In the future, I'll be moving the page objects that I create here into their own separate folder, housed in [Page Object Helper](https://github.com/DevynnGrey/pageobject-helper). This will allow me to access all page objects that I create from any repo that I work in.
